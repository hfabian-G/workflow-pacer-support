# Privacy Policy for Workflow Pacer

**Effective Date:** 01/20/2026

## 1. Overview
We respect your privacy. **Workflow Pacer** ("the App") is designed to be a utility for UX professionals to measure their own mouse usage. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data, usage statistics, or analytics.

## 2. No Data Collection
The App operates under a strict "local-only" policy.
* **We do not collect personal information:** We do not ask for your name, email, or phone number.
* **We do not collect usage data:** We do not track how you use the app or send analytics to any third-party server.
* **We do not use cookies or tracking technologies.**

## 3. Data Storage and Mouse Movement Data
To function, the App measures your mouse cursor distance and movement patterns.
* **All calculation and processing happens locally on your device.**
* The raw data regarding your mouse movements is processed in real-time to provide feedback and is not permanently stored or transmitted.
* Any settings or preferences you save are stored locally on your Mac using standard Apple storage methods (e.g., UserDefaults or local files).

## 4. Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate with any third-party SDKs, advertising networks, or analytics providers. It does not make any network requests to external servers.

## 5. System Permissions
The App may request macOS system permissions (such as Accessibility or Input Monitoring) solely to perform its core function of measuring mouse distance. This permission is used strictly for this calculation and is never used to record keystrokes or sensitive input.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Since the App does not collect contact information, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. Continued use of the App implies acceptance of the policy.
